<p>The St. Joan Fair arrives every spring like clockwork, the week before the Memorial Day weekend.  This was a big social event for all the kids and teenagers of Grosse Pointe.   Kara had an online friendship with one of the workers from the carnival, who also liked the band Insane Clown Posse, or ICP for short.  She had hung out with him the previous year while the fair was in town, ironically the day before she met Michael.  She introduced Michael to Matthew but Michael forbade her from visiting with him again. They got into a big fight and stopped speaking for a day. We all attended her nephew’s birthday party that Saturday afternoon.  Michael was not there. Kara told her sister-in-law that she was thinking of breaking up with Michael.  Later that night Kara hung out with her friend from the fair.  I texted her at midnight and she texted back that she was hanging out with her friend Matthew and would soon return.  The next day, Sunday, she went back to the fair and returned with a huge stuffed tiger and was wearing an ICP cap. She realized that she needed to return the cap and went back to the fair to return it. During her absence Michael showed up at the house asking for Kara. I told him she wasn’t there (he didn’t have cell service depending on his mother’s whim).  She showed up a few minutes later.  When I told her what happened her face went ashen.  She was absolutely terrified.  I couldn’t understand why she was so upset. I thought he was passive and weak, not a threat at all. I was so wrong.  They did meet again and seemed to have made up by Sunday night, May 22nd.  All seemed well.</p>

<p>I shielded my husband from much of what was going on. He disliked Michael and barely tolerated him. My husband and I were supposed to go to a convention on Mackinac Island right before Memorial Day weekend.  When Kara and Michael were fighting the previous weekend I was feeling that I couldn’t go to the convention, he might act out with no parental figures around.  I relaxed though when on that Monday, May 23rd, they seemed to be happy and loving again.  I remember having a conversation with Michael (while Kara was taking care of her new guinea pigs) about Kara’s childhood and her love of animals.  I said she would make a great mom.  He thanked me for talking to him.  The next day was Tuesday, May 24th.  Kara and Michael took Kurt to Mason’s playground at about 6:15. A worker from Mason said they couldn’t be there because of the after school program (except the sign said it was finished at 6:00).  Kara stood up for her brother and would not leave.  She could be so tough when standing up for others but when it came to herself&hellip; I remember telling her that Tuesday night that when we came back from our convention we were going to limit the amount of time he could be over our house.  Early Wednesday morning my daughter woke me at 1 a.m. to look at her one guinea pig. She thought it was having trouble breathing.  She was understandably nervous because one of her guinea pigs had died two weeks ago.  We hung out and the guinea pig seemed fine.  That would be the last time we ever hung out.  She again woke me and said she was feeling nervous.  I settled her down and went back to sleep.  The next morning I sent Kurt off to school and my husband and I prepared to go on our trip.  It took  longer to get ready and we were running late. When my husband was in the other room Michael showed up at the front door.  I told him to wait behind the garage that we would soon be gone.  I went up to Kara, who was sleeping, and told her Michael was waiting outside.  She came downstairs and we hugged.  It is the last time we hugged.  And then we went to our Mackinac Island convention.  Something we had done every year for over twenty years.  It was May 25th.</p>

<p>Kara and I texted a few times that Thursday, May 26th.  When she had gotten Kurt on the bus with no problems, I relaxed.  I didn’t contact Kara till Friday, May 27th, at 2:45 p.m.  I called her at home and she answered.  We made small talk and I asked her, “Are you and Michael getting along?” she answered in a sing song voice, “yes.”   I interpreted the “yes” to mean she was getting sick of him. I didn’t detect that she was in danger.  When I was ready to say goodbye I said in a very serious tone, “Kara I love you”.  She said it back.  It was the last time I talked to her.</p>

<p>On Saturday, May 28th, we headed back home from up north.  We stopped in West Branch for about an hour, and ate a late lunch at Burger King.  At 4 p.m. I texted Kara that we would be home around 6 , make sure Michael wasn’t there and would she like some Wendys.  She did not text back.  I called the home phone and it rang endlessly.  Within a few minutes I was in full blown panic as we raced home from West Branch.  All of my relatives who had keys were out of town that weekend too so I had no one to call.  Your mind tries to come up with a  reasonable explanation, like, maybe the electricity is out, maybe they are at the park but the terror builds anyway, my cell went dead after calling continuously for two hours.</p>
