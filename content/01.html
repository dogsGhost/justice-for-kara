<p>Kara had been talking online to Michael Andrew Gray in the weeks before they met. He had been briefly dating her best friend the year before.  He was 19, a strong young man with dark good looks. He stood close to six feet tall.  Kara was 18, a petite young woman who stood barely five feet tall.  Her most striking feature was her sky blue eyes. She changed hair styles often and was most comfortable in a hoodie and basketball shorts. They met for the first time on Sunday of Memorial Day weekend 2010. Kara would graduate from Grosse Pointe North a week later. They grew enamored of each other and were quickly inseparable.  By the following Memorial Day, Kara was dead and Michael was a suspect in her death, but not at first.</p>

<p>Kara was the fourth child, the baby, born to me and my husband. We lived in our funeral home for the first four years of her life. She was a sensitive, insect, animal loving girl. She got away from the insects but still thoroughly loved animals.  She had a ferret, guinea pigs and three cats. She was a bit of a tomboy but not because of sports. Her favorite activities included playing video games, hanging with her family and the internet. She was our only lefty and very creative. She was always drawing, sculpting, writing and taking photographs.  Some of her subjects could be a little dark but she loved Disney movies and Anime too. In many ways she was a late bloomer and a little bit of a loner. She was never one to have flocks of friends or go to parties; there would be just a few close friends.  One of the reasons Kara stuck so close to home was her brother Kurt, a year older than her, was profoundly autistic.</p>

<p>It is my observation that because of having an autistic brother Kara tended to pick friends, boyfriends and internet friends who were a little bit “broken” too.  Kara’s older siblings went to college, married and had kids and were out of the house by the time Kara turned 10. I was very close to Kara. She could be extremely shy and I would support her.  We had our private jokes and we laughed long and hard. She shared many of her thoughts and hopes with me. She wanted to be an occupational therapist or someone who used art to help special needs children.  She wanted a family and children some day.  All along it was Kurt, Kara and I doing everything together (my husband was working).  We included whatever boyfriend or friend wanted to tag along. For the most part it worked.</p>

<p>The summer of 2010 was one of our best summers. Kurt was becoming much more manageable, Kara was happy and my husband and I were able to go on an enjoyable trip by ourselves. By the end of August Kara started college at M.C.C.C .  That is when the trouble started.</p>

<p>She texted him some cool fact she had learned in her class. He texted back “So you think you’re smarter than me”. It went downhill from there.  He started to get jealous and controlling. He accused her of cheating constantly.  By the end of October I started to intervene. I would tell her he will not stop. One day they argued on the porch(I was within ear shot) he insisted she cheated, she said no, you cheated, no she said. Then she told him to leave. She screamed at him as he walked away down the street. A few minutes later, he would lie down in his tub and slit his wrists. He would be hospitalized many times thereafter.</p>

<p>There were a few more times that he tried to make contact and he called her names when she rejected him, but she held her ground.  We had watched a Lifetime movie shortly after the breakup. It was about an abusive boyfriend. At one point a character in the film listed 12 examples of an abusive boyfriend. She checked off 11 of the 12 examples. The only example she didn’t check off was physical abuse. How many of you are foolishly hanging on because the only thing that hasn’t occurred yet is a slap? Sometimes number 12 is the only time there is physical abuse but you are dead and it’s too late. But I digress. Kara had a nice new boyfriend and they dated two months (she rebounded too quickly perhaps) but that ended on January 9, 2011. Michael had written a few favorable comments on an art site that Kara displayed art. She went to him that very day, smitten as always.</p>

<p>My husband and I were not happy that she had gotten back together with Michael.  I relented one day when they started looking for jobs on the internet. He was on medication and seemed to be a changed person. Soon Kara landed her first job, a courtesy clerk, at Kroger. He landed a job at a different Kroger.  Kara continued to go to work, school and hang out with Michael at our house (having them at my house gave me a little control too).  Things started to fall apart around the beginning of April. Michael lost his job.</p>
