<p>Michael had stopped taking his medications because they weren’t available because of some bureaucratic snafu. The accusations started again. Kara’s phone went missing. She told me that Michael might be schizophrenic. In spite of this she continued to see him. At some point I felt she would have to come to the right decision, but it would be her decision, not mine. One day she asked me what the word “concede” meant. I asked her what sentence was it used in. She said it was a text from Michael saying she should concede that she was cheating.</p>

<p>Kara told me Michael and his sister had been adopted by Sylvia Gray (I am not sure if there used to be a husband too) when he was five and his sister was six. They were allegedly abused by their birth father. They lived in Grosse Pointe Farms.  Both Michael and his sister were going to Grosse Pointe South when their world fell apart again.  They had been living in a hoard house with over 40 cats and other animals.  This story was splashed across metro Detroit newspapers. Their house would be demolished. The three of them relocated to St. Clair Shores, a few blocks from the Grosse Pointe Woods’ border. Apparently Michael did well in his St. Clair Shores’ high school until the fall of his senior year. He had a breakdown and was hospitalized for the first time. He would never finish high school even though he was really smart.  He went back to night school several times to finish the last few credits but he never did finish.</p>

<p>Several times during the last months of her life Kara would ask me why, why, why does he do these things.  My reply was always “He is mentally ill and will never change.”  He kind of reminded me of that old fable/song where the snake asks to be taken across the river, promising not to bite.  On the other side, after being bitten, you ask the snake why and he replies, “You knew I was a snake”.</p>

<p>His mother threatened to kick him out of her house constantly. He paid her $25 a month for room and board. When he lost his job Kara would give him $25  to placate his mother. He also didn’t tell her he had lost his job until mid May after Kara wouldn’t give him any more money.</p>

<p>There were many times when the two of them hanging out here were quite normal. I usually fed him as well as my daughter and he was very polite as well as grateful.  The doubts would hit him when he went home. They would get along very well and then a few hours later he would be accusatory all over again.  There were a few erratic moments that I personally witnessed. In early May I was doing laundry on the second floor all alone. I looked up and he was in the hall with me by Kara’s closed door (she was at school). I exclaimed &ldquo;You scared me&rdquo;, &ldquo;Kara’s not here&rdquo;. He wanted to open her door but didn’t. Another time in early May, Kara came to me saying she was scared. I opened the front door and there Michael stood. I said, “Go home”. He complied. It was 3 a.m. Things really started to fall apart the third week of May.</p>

<p>One time it crossed my mind that he could kill her, especially if they were breaking up. There would be reports in the news of suicidal men who killed their partners before taking their own lives. I dismissed the thought: people don’t get killed in the Grosse Pointes.  In person when he would get angry at Kara, he walked away.  My stupid reasoning was if he was here in person, he would have nothing to be jealous of.  I didn’t see him as a threat, although in hindsight all the red flags were there.  Please listen to your intuition.</p>
