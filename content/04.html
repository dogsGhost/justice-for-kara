<p><img src="img/kara-junior.jpg" alt="">We arrived at our house around 6 p.m.  The front and back door were open.  It was dark and musty (he was a smoker) and all three cats were hiding.  I told my husband to wait at the bottom of the stairs with his phone ready.  I went upstairs and glanced in Kara’s room.  Then I saw Kurt watching his t.v. in his room.  I walked down the hall to our room and it was empty.  I saw a phone and it’s cradle laying in the middle of the hall.  I went back to Kara’s room and said to myself, Kara doesn’t make the bed.  I went to her bed and pulled back the cover.  She was dead, her body was staged.  She was on her back with her arms folded across her chest.  Her face was almost a normal color but there was mottling of blood along the lowest point of her head.  She didn’t smell. There was no mess. I touched only the edge of her arm, which was stiff from rigor mortis. Her eyes were partly opened, unseeing.  She was wearing her ratty old Big Dog pajamas with her bare feet slightly open to the side.  I was screaming, “She’s dead, she’s dead, she’s dead,” over and over again till I lost my voice. I peed myself. My husband came upstairs at this point.  He called 911.  I had noticed a picture of the joker next to her pillow.  At the time, I thought it had fallen off her wall and I ripped it up into little pieces.  Months later I would realize its significance.</p>

<p>I ran out of our house and sank to my knees on the driveway.  My neighbor asked me what was wrong and I told her. She also called the police. Another neighbor gave me a bottle of water. I called my son and told him Kara was dead. He wanted to talk to my neighbor, who confirmed it. My son called his sister and gave her the bad news. When the police arrived I heard someone from upstairs say “D.O.A.” Our nightmare had officially begun.</p>

<p>I noticed that all the home phones were unplugged and Kara’s phone was thrown in the hall. I also noticed that Michael’s clothes/suitcase were there as well as his coat, keys and laptop. I looked in her purse and saw that her bank card was missing. Soon I was talking to Detective A. Chalut, the head detective for Grosse Pointe Woods.  I probably came off a little detached initially, shock will do that to you, and I didn’t cry that first day at all. Stoically, I answered Detective Chalut’s  questions to the best of my ability. I told him about Kara’s missing bank card. I gave him a copy of Michael’s social security card and state i.d.   Detective Chalut told me she died around 6 a.m.  By about 10 p.m. the coroner came to take her body away.  Other than finding my daughter dead, the second worst thing was seeing her taken out my front door in a body bag.  They said don’t look, but I did, such a searing, painful memory.  We had no idea why or how our beautiful daughter died.  The coming months did little to answer that question.</p>

<p>The first thing that the police had to do was locate Michael.  The first thing that we had to do was plan a funeral. Having grown up in the business didn’t make it any easier.  There was a candlelight vigil at Grosse Pointe North. We had to get through the first days and weeks one day at a time.  The day before Kara’s funeral I got a letter from her bank saying fraud was suspected.  $400 had been withdrawn from her account on May 28th.  I called the police to inform them but they already knew.  They also had picked up Michael on the morning of May 29th.  They didn’t want to talk to us until after Kara’s funeral,  June  4th.</p>
