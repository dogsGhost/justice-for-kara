<p>My relationship with Detective Chalut at times could be frustrating or enlightening.  He was very secretive and contradictory at times and on other occasions he was very forthcoming.  Detective Chalut said he talked to the state police and the FBI.  The other professionals that I would deal with were Dr. F Diaz, medical examiner, and prosecutor M. Reynolds.</p>

<p>Michael was picked up on Sunday morning, May 29th, hiding in the garage of his friend.  The friend’s mother had called the St. Clair Shore’s police.  The Grosse Pointe Police picked him up.  At that time he was interviewed for 1 ½ hours.  At first, he denied being at our house.  After the detective grilled him about how sad Kara’s parents would be, he broke down and cried while admitting that he was there.  He said he found her dead.  He denied having anything to do with her death.  I understand that he lied about many things but I have not seen the tape.  What I do know now, is he was out of our house and at his own house by 8 a.m. on that Saturday morning that Kara died.  Soon he left his house in such an erratic state that his mother called the St. Clair Shores Police to find him.  After  he was picked up by the Woods police and  interviewed, they let him go. He promptly checked into the psych ward.</p>

<p>About a month later, in the early morning, I found a package on my porch.  It was a plastic bag that had a burn mark on the edge of it. A silver #1 mom bracelet was inside.  This package was meant for me.  Inside was a candy tin mint coffin.  Inside it was divided in four parts:  the upper two quadrants had white dead moths in them. On each side of the bottom quadrants was a paper.  One paper was a cross with the number 33 on it, next to it were the numbers 52,72. The other cross was upside down with the number 23 in it. The numbers 64, 62 were next to it. The upside down cross had a spade on it and the other cross had a heart on it. This was from Michael.  How did I know?  In the weeks before Kara died, some of the things she gave him would appear on the front porch having been left in the middle of the night.  The card symbols were from the “joker”.  It was bizarre and no one knew what the numbers meant.  His facebook handle was “Glazgow smile”.  Glazgow smile is the split grin of someone who has had a knife pulled upward on their face from the corners of their mouth.  The joker had a “Glazgow smile”.  Recently Michael has gone back on facebook.  His profile picture is a skeleton with crosses and spades.  His new moniker is Glazgow.deadend.smile.</p>
