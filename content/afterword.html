<p>Please pass this narrative along.  Someone out there knows something.  Legislators, if you have a law that says psychiatric workers can break patient privilege if they think their patient is going to commit murder, why not have a law that lets them break confidentiality if someone confesses to a murder.</p>
<p>If you have any pertinent information contact me, Alexandra Wilhelm, at <a href="mailto:alexandrawilhelm2@gmail.com">alexandrawilhelm2@gmail.com</a>. Detective Chalut can be contacted by email at <a href="mailto:achulut@gpwmi.us">achulut@gpwmi.us</a> or by phone at 313-343-2412.<br>
Thank you.</p>
