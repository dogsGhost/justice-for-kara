<p>In early July 2011, the medical examiner called us at home.  He had no idea how Kara had died.  Her toxicity report was totally negative.  She had suffusion of the face and a white mark to the chin but other than that everything was normal. Her death was listed as “undeterminable.”  He asked if we wanted him to perform more tests and we said yes.  Nothing came of those tests either.</p>

<p>In late July our daughter’s case took a dramatic turn when an anonymous person from Henry Ford Hospital called.  He/she claimed that the police should investigate Kara’s death, providing a specific medical record number from one of Michael’s psychiatric stays.  A subpoena was served on the hospital for the medical record.  They were turned down, citing doctor/patient privilege. Phone and facebook records were subpoenaed (and granted).  They also forensically searched both Kara and Michael’s laptops.</p>

<p>In late December 2011, prosecutor Reynolds called us.  He was investigating Kara’s death.  He came to our home in early 2012 and talked to us for four hours.  He had asked us whether we thought Michael was schizophrenic.  At the time I said no but I have since changed my mind. He claimed that he took care of the hard cases and had a good record of prosecuting them.  He gave us his number and left.  When I called him a week later with some information he basically blew me off. We never talked again except when my call went through and he quickly got off the phone.</p>

<p>Michael moved to Chesterfield Township in the spring of 2012.  Perhaps his mother finally kicked him out.  He received disability funds.</p>

<p>The police decided to prosecute Michael for the theft of Kara’s money.  Michael had stolen $400 from an ATM on Mack, located between our homes.  He took this money on Saturday, May 28, 2011, the day Kara died.  To this day I don’t know the exact time he took that money but I will assume it was after Kara died.  The judge at Michael’s sentencing wanted to know the answer to that too but no one had that answer.  When Michael was first picked up in June 2012, he was unrecognizable.  He had gained 40 pounds on the various medications he was taking. They initially charged him with the theft of her money and identity theft.  He pled guilty to the theft.  His actual sentencing was a joke.  He missed the first date in court in early October 2012 because he was in the psych ward again.  Two weeks later he made his appearance under threat of jailing.</p>

<p>When it was time to read the victim’s statement this is what I said:</p>
<blockquote>&ldquo;Our daughter Kara died on a Saturday morning, May 28, 2011, while you were staying with her and her brother.  You say you found her dead, but did you call 911? No, you posed her with a picture of the joker and covered her.  Did you call someone to watch Kurt, Kara’s severely autistic brother? No, you left him for what turned out to be 10 hours alone, while you helped yourself to Kara’s bankcard and $400 from an atm.  Did you go home because you were freaked out?  No, you were hiding in a friend’s garage.  What kind of person behaves like this?  Certainly a coward but what else are you?  You are a person who left a grieving mom a package with a #1 mom bracelet and a candy coffin with two dead moths in it with numbers.  You are a person who wrote on his facebook:”  I put your body in a hole, fifty feet underground, I’ll be walking here on earth while you’re nowhere to be found (an icp lyric).”  And your poem “Dead end”: “I did it.  It’s done and no I’m not scared.”  What did you do Michael?  Did you get tired of Kara’s supposed cheating? Again? And silence her?  That would make you a monster.  You will probably get probation today but that will not be the end of it for you.  You need to tell us what you did instead of leaving clues or you will never have peace.</blockquote>

<p>Michael’s “Dead End” poem ended with a cryptic; “Eye’ll see you in hell.” He deliberately spelled I’ll wrong because it was a specific reference to Kara, who liked to use “eyes” in her art.  The package I received on my porch also had a burn mark on it indicating hell too.</p>

<p>Judge Grohner gave him probation, apologizing for not knowing the circumstances surrounding the theft.  He asked if there was an investigation and other questions which I answered.  He fined Michael including missing pay for my husband.  He was to pay that within a week or risk jail time.  He paid that money, but it went to the bank first, erroneously.  To my knowledge he hasn’t paid a dime in restitution since.  In October 2015, he will be off probation with a totally clean record because of his youth.</p>
