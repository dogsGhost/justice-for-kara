<p>In the summer of 2013 I tried to <abbr title="Freedom of Information Act">FOIA</abbr> the police records and was turned down because it was an active investigation.  I was able to obtain autopsy records.  I turned them over to Dr. Werner Spitz.  He suggested other blood tests for Dr. Diaz to complete.  Those tests came back negative.  All along the hardest part of the investigation has been “How did she die?”  I once asked Detective Chalut if he thought my daughter was murdered.  He replied, “probably.”  Most everyone felt that she was asphyxiated in some manner.  Without all the records Dr. Spitz could not reach a conclusion either.  He said, “Asphyxiation is hard to prove.” Nevertheless, Dr. Spitz’s involvement seemed to spur Dr. Diaz to be more involved.  In the fall of 2013 he told me he was going to change Kara’s death certificate from “undetermined” to “homicide”.  He felt that her death was first degree murder.  He felt that she was fast asleep and by the time she realized what was happening, it was too late.  He met with the head prosecutor.  Very soon after, Dr. Diaz did a 180 degree turn stating maybe it wasn’t a homicide after all. It was as though one of his superiors shut him down. The head prosecutor told me that there just wasn’t enough evidence to prosecute.  Everyone backed off.  I was devastated all over again.</p>

<p>I basically did nothing regarding Kara’s case in 2014 except ponder getting this story out to the public. Nothing of substance had materialized.  It has been close to four years since Kara died.  Our family has no closure while Michael lives out his life supported by the government.</p>

<p>One of the worst things I have dealt with other than the profound grief has been my memories of Kara.  Every time I thought of her, his memory was attached to hers, like the unwanted parasite that he is.</p>

<p>In the beginning I cried every day.  Then I cried once a week (this phase lasted three years).  Now I cry a couple of times a month.  But I have been known  to breakout in tears if someone’s child dies on the news or on a t.v. show.  I watch all the dateline type shows for clues/commiseration.  It is my observation that women are mostly murdered by their partner for similar reasons.  Those reasons include money/theft (whether it is $400, a laptop or a million dollar life insurance policy), for love of another or jealousy.</p>

<p>I like this quote from the author Harlen Coben:</p>
<blockquote>&ldquo;We all want to convince ourselves that it is about hard work and perseverance, but the truth is, life is much more about the fickle and the random.  We don’t want to admit it, but we are controlled by luck, by timing, by fate.</blockquote>

<p>One last thing bears repeating; An innocent person would have called 911.</p>
