<p>Before the sudden and untimely deaths of Jane, Sabrina and Paige in December 2014, another young woman from the Grosse Pointes lost her life in a manner that, to this day, has yet to be resolved.</p>

<p>While our hearts and sympathy go out to all the families of all who have experienced similar tragedies, this website will bring out into the open the events surrounding, and the investigative processes since Kara Iryne Wilhelmâ€™s death on May 28, 2011.  She was found by her parents, lying in her bed in the early evening of that date.</p>

<p>We hope that by going public, someone will come forward with significant information, so that justice for Kara may become a reality.</p>
